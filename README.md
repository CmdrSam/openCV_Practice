# openCV Practice
The scripts folder contains the basic implementations of openCV functions

## Problems Faced
  1. (-215:Assertion failed) size.width>0 && size.height>0 in function 'cv::imshow'<br />
  **Solution** : Check if the image path is correct or try to give full path. In my case it was not working still, closing and reopening                    the file helped
